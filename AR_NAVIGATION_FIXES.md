# AR Navigation and Animation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Bouncing Animation Speed** ✅
**Problem**: The NFT images were bouncing too quickly and aggressively.

**Solution**: 
- Increased animation duration from 2 seconds to 4 seconds
- Reduced bounce range from 0.9-1.0 to 0.95-1.0 for more subtle movement
- Made the animation more gentle and less distracting

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/features/ar_view/ar_view_screen.dart` - Updated `_setupAnimations()` method

### 2. **Navigation Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Back buttons were showing black screens instead of proper navigation.

**Solution**: 
- Changed all `context.go()` calls to `Navigator.of(context).pop()` for proper back navigation
- Fixed navigation in multiple screens:
  - Event Join Screen
  - Wallet Options Screen  
  - AR View Screen

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/features/event_joining/event_join_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/wallet/wallet_options_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/ar_view/ar_view_screen.dart`

### 3. **Event-Specific Boundaries** ✅
**Problem**: Users could see boundaries from other events when using different event codes.

**Solution**:
- Added event filtering in AR service to only show boundaries from the current event
- Enhanced boundary filtering in AR view screen
- Added proper event ID validation

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/shared/services/ar_service.dart` - Added event filtering in `setEvent()` method
- `lib/features/ar_view/ar_view_screen.dart` - Added event ID validation in `_updateARPositions()`

### 4. **3D Image Orientation** ✅
**Problem**: Images lacked proper 3D depth perception and positioning.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced 3D positioning with depth perception
- Added perspective transforms and dynamic scaling
- Improved shadow effects based on distance
- Added subtle rotation and tilt for more realistic 3D appearance

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/features/ar_view/ar_view_screen.dart` - Enhanced `_buildPositionedAROverlay()` method

## Technical Details

### Animation Improvements
```dart
// Before: Fast, aggressive bouncing
bounceController = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
  vsync: this,
);
bounceAnimation = Tween<double>(begin: 0.9, end: 1.0).animate(...);

// After: Slow, subtle bouncing
bounceController = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(seconds: 4), // Much slower
  vsync: this,
);
bounceAnimation = Tween<double>(begin: 0.95, end: 1.0).animate(...); // More subtle range
```

### Navigation Fixes
```dart
// Before: Causing black screens
onPressed: () => context.go('/wallet/options')

// After: Proper back navigation
onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop()
```

### Event Filtering
```dart
// Added in AR Service
_boundaries = _boundaries.where((boundary) => boundary.eventId == event.id).toList();

// Added in AR View Screen
if (boundary.eventId != currentEvent?.id) {
  continue; // Skip boundaries from other events
}
```

### 3D Enhancements
```dart
// Enhanced 3D positioning with depth perception
double depthFactor = 1.0 - (distance / 5.0).clamp(0.0, 1.0);
double screenY = screenHeight * 0.2 + (distance * 15) - (depthFactor * 50);

// Added perspective transforms
Transform(
  transform: Matrix4.identity()
    ..setEntry(3, 2, 0.001) // Add perspective
    ..rotateY(element.distance * 0.01) // Subtle rotation
    ..rotateX(element.distance * 0.005), // Subtle tilt
  child: // NFT content
)
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Animation Speed**: Test that NFT images bounce slowly and smoothly
2. **Navigation**: Verify back buttons work properly on all screens
3. **Event Isolation**: Test with multiple event codes to ensure boundaries are event-specific
4. **3D Effects**: Check that images have proper depth perception and 3D appearance

## Additional Improvements Made

- Added better error handling and logging for debugging
- Enhanced visual feedback with improved shadows and gradients
- Reduced randomness in positioning for more stable AR experience
- Added comprehensive logging for event and boundary loading
