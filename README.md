# FaceReflector - AR-Powered Event Goodies App

An innovative Flutter application that combines Augmented Reality (AR) technology with Web3 concepts to create interactive event experiences where users can claim virtual goodies by exploring real-world locations.

## üåü Features

### For Event Organizers
- **Event Creation**: Create events with custom boundaries and goodies
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Automatically deploy NFT contracts for each event
- **Map Integration**: Draw boundaries on Google Maps to define claimable areas
- **NFT Management**: Configure NFT metadata and IPFS storage
- **Real-time Management**: Monitor event progress and user engagement

### For Event Participants
- **AR Experience**: Immersive AR view with real-time boundary detection
- **Proximity Detection**: Get hints about how close you are to claimable boundaries
- **Progress Tracking**: See your progress through claimed vs total boundaries
- **NFT Claiming**: Claim real NFTs when you reach boundaries
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect your wallet using WalletConnect

### Core Features
- **Location-based AR**: Boundaries only appear when you're within 2 meters
- **Blockchain Integration**: Real smart contracts for NFT minting and claiming
- **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized metadata storage via Pinata
- **Cross-platform**: iOS and Android support
