# FaceReflector Enhanced Event Creation - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to update your existing FaceReflector app with the enhanced event creation system that includes all the features you requested.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Splash Screen Background
**Problem**: The splash screen had a black background in the bottom half of the screen.

**Solution**: Updated `lib/features/splash/splash_screen.dart`:
- Added `width: double.infinity` and `height: double.infinity` to the Container
- Removed the complex LayoutBuilder structure
- Simplified to use a Column with proper spacing
- Now the gradient background covers the entire screen

## üöÄ Enhanced Event Creation Features

### Required Features Implementation

#### 1. Event Details Step
- **Event Title**: Required text field with validation
- **Event Description**: Multi-line text area with validation
- **Start Date & Time**: Date picker and time picker
- **End Date & Time**: Date picker and time picker
- **Venue/Location**: Required text field
- **NFT Supply Count**: Number input (default: 50) with validation
- **NFT Image Selection**: Image picker for the NFT that will be shown in AR

#### 2. Area Selection Step
- **Interactive Map**: Google Maps integration
- **Location Search**: Search for specific locations
- **Current Location**: Auto-detect user's location
- **Area Radius**: Slider to set event area (50m - 500m)
- **Visual Feedback**: Circle overlay showing event area

#### 3. Boundary Configuration Step
- **Claim Radius**: Slider to set boundary claim distance (1m - 5m)
- **Event Summary**: Preview of all configured settings
- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields are completed

#### 4. Boundary Placement Step
- **Interactive Placement**: Tap map to place boundary locations
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows placement progress (X/50 boundaries)
- **Visual Markers**: Green markers for each NFT location
- **Validation**: Ensures all boundaries are placed before creation
- **Exact Count**: Must place exactly the number of boundaries equal to NFT supply count

## üì± Key Features

### For Event Organizers
1. **Complete Event Setup**: Title, description, dates, venue, NFT count
2. **NFT Image Selection**: Choose the image that will appear in AR
3. **Precise Boundary Placement**: Tap-to-place interface for exact NFT locations
4. **Real-time Validation**: Ensures all requirements are met
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress through the creation process

### For Event Participants
1. **Proximity Notifications**: Distance-based alerts (100m, 50m, 20m, 10m, 5m)
2. **Progress Bars**: Visual progress towards boundaries
3. **Boundary Visibility**: Only see boundaries when within 2 meters
4. **Claim Management**: One-time claim system
5. **AR Integration**: NFT image appears in AR at boundary locations
6. **Claim Status**: Shows "Already Claimed" in AR when boundary is taken

## üîß Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Database
Run the SQL script from `database_updates.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

### Step 2: Update Dependencies
Add to `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
flutter_local_notifications: ^17.2.2
intl: ^0.19.0
```

### Step 3: Update Models
The models have been updated with new fields:
- `Event`: Added NFT supply count, event image, notification distances
- `Boundary`: Added NFT token ID, metadata, progress tracking, visibility control

### Step 4: Replace Event Creation Screen
Replace your existing `event_creation_screen.dart` with the enhanced version that includes:

#### 4-Step Process:
1. **Event Details**: Title, description, dates, venue, NFT count, NFT image
2. **Area Selection**: Interactive map with radius control
3. **Boundary Configuration**: Claim radius and settings
4. **Boundary Placement**: Tap-to-place exactly NFT supply count locations

### Step 5: Update Services
The Supabase service has been enhanced with:
- `getNearbyBoundaries()`: Returns nearby boundaries with progress
- `updateBoundaryVisibility()`: Updates boundary visibility
- `logUserProximity()`: Logs proximity data for analytics

### Step 6: Add Location Service
The location service handles:
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Proximity notifications
- Boundary visibility management
- Progress tracking

## üéØ AR Integration Features

### NFT Image Display
- The selected NFT image appears in AR at each boundary location
- Image is positioned using the boundary's AR position data
- Scales and rotates based on boundary configuration

### Claim Status in AR
- Shows "Already Claimed" overlay when boundary is taken
- Prevents duplicate claims
- Updates in real-time as users claim boundaries

### Proximity Notifications
- Smart notifications at configurable distances
- Prevents notification spam
- Shows progress towards boundaries

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Distance-based Progress
- 100%: Within claim radius (can claim)
- 80%: Within 10 meters
- 60%: Within 50 meters
- 40%: Within 100 meters
- 20%: Beyond 100 meters

### Visual Indicators
- Progress bars showing proximity to boundaries
- Color-coded markers for different states
- Real-time updates as user moves

## üîí Security & Validation

### Input Validation
- Required fields validation
- NFT supply count must be positive integer
- NFT image is required
- All boundaries must be placed

### Claim Protection
- One-time claim system
- Prevents duplicate claims
- Real-time status updates

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the Enhanced Flow**: Test the 4-step event creation process
2. **Verify AR Integration**: Ensure NFT images appear correctly in AR
3. **Test Notifications**: Verify proximity notifications work
4. **Performance Testing**: Test on real devices with GPS
5. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on the new features
