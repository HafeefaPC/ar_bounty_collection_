# Supabase Client Initialization Fix

## Problem Solved

**Error**: `LatelnitializationError: Field '_client@58015468' has not been initialized.`

## Root Cause

The SupabaseService was using `late final SupabaseClient _client` with a custom `initialize()` method, but the client wasn't being properly initialized before use. This caused the "field has not been initialized" error.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ **Simplified Client Access**
**File**: `lib/shared/services/supabase_service.dart`

```dart
// Before: Complex initialization with late final
late final SupabaseClient _client;

Future<void> initialize() async {
  // Complex initialization logic...
}

// After: Simple getter that uses global instance
SupabaseClient get _client => Supabase.instance.client;
```

### ✅ **Removed Custom Initialization**
- Removed the `initialize()` method completely
- Removed all `await supabaseService.initialize()` calls
- Now relies on global Supabase initialization in `main.dart`

### ✅ **Fixed Schema Mismatch**
- Removed `last_notification_distance` field from boundary data
- Ensured code matches cleaned database schema

## How It Works Now

1. **Global Initialization**: Supabase is initialized once in `main.dart` before `runApp()`
2. **Service Access**: SupabaseService uses `Supabase.instance.client` directly
3. **No Manual Initialization**: No need to call `initialize()` methods

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/shared/services/supabase_service.dart`**
   - Changed `late final SupabaseClient _client` to `SupabaseClient get _client => Supabase.instance.client`
   - Removed `initialize()` method
   - Removed `last_notification_distance` field from boundary data

2. **`lib/main.dart`** (already correct)
   - Supabase initialized globally before app starts

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Database Connection**: Should work ✅
2. **Test Event Creation**: Should work without initialization errors ✅
3. **Test Event Joining**: Should work properly ✅

The app should now work without any Supabase initialization errors!
