# Database Schema Mismatch Fix

## Problem Solved

**Error**: `PostgrestException(message: Could not find the 'last_notification_distance' column of 'boundaries' in the schema cache, code: PGRST204, details: Bad Request, hint: null)`

## Root Cause

The code was trying to insert a `last_notification_distance` field that was removed from the cleaned database schema. The Boundary model and SupabaseService were still referencing fields that no longer exist in the database.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed from Boundary Model** ✅
**File**: `lib/shared/models/boundary.dart`

```dart
// Before: Had lastNotificationDistance field
final int? lastNotificationDistance;

// After: Removed the field completely
// Field removed from constructor, copyWith, toJson, and fromJson methods
```

### 2. **Removed from SupabaseService** ✅
**File**: `lib/shared/services/supabase_service.dart`

```dart
// Before: Trying to insert non-existent field
'last_notification_distance': boundary.lastNotificationDistance,

// After: Removed the field from boundary data
// Field removed from boundaryData map
```

### 3. **Updated Methods** ✅
- Removed `updateNotificationDistance()` method functionality
- Updated `getNotificationMessage()` method to not use the field
- Cleaned up `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods

## Fields Removed

### ❌ **Removed from Code**:
- `lastNotificationDistance` - Boundary model field
- `last_notification_distance` - Database column reference
- `updateNotificationDistance()` - Method functionality

### ✅ **Kept in Code**:
- All essential fields for AR functionality
- All fields that exist in the cleaned database schema
- Proper JSON serialization/deserialization

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Event Creation**: Should now work without schema errors
2. **Test Database Connection**: Should still work
3. **Test Event Joining**: Should work with proper boundary loading

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/shared/models/boundary.dart`** - Removed lastNotificationDistance field
2. **`lib/shared/services/supabase_service.dart`** - Removed field from boundary data

The app should now work properly with the cleaned database schema!
